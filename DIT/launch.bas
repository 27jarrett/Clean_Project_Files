' You might have other functions, e.g., to generate data for the Excel file
' that the Python script then uses. These would also need sanitization.
' For example, if you had a function to pull data from an internal database:
' Sub GetDataFromInternalDB()
'     MsgBox "Simulating data retrieval from a generic source. (No actual database connection)", vbInformation
'     ' Original code would have had ADO/DAO connection strings and SQL queries to internal DBs.
'     ' These lines would be removed or mocked like this.
